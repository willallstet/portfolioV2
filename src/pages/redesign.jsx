            , I redesigned Powerhouse Bookstore's home page. It was out of date
            and hard to navigate. As a writer and avid reader, I appricate the
            importance of independent booksellers and wanted to help modernize
            an iconic NYC one.

            When designing my wireframes, I tried to identify the major problems
            with Powerhouse's website and remedy them. The issues I identified
            (and solved in the sub-bullets) were:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>The page had lots of redundant information</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>only listed staff picks and social media links once</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      removed any information that was on other pages on the
                      website
                    </p>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Unclear navigation&nbsp;</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      removed the menu bar, as all the info was linked elsewhere
                      in the page and mostly focused on their publishing arm,
                      despite it having its own website
                    </p>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>No way to edit the cart when looking at it</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>Made items removable in the cart</p>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>No hierarchy of information</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      Split the page into two sections: book browsing and
                      bookstore information
                    </p>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Events calendar doesnâ€™t show event names</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      Only listed upcoming events, linking to the full calendar
                      for more detailed information
                    </p>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Busy, text heavy design</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      Reworked their copy to display the same information in
                      less space
                    </p>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Columns collapse in weird order when page gets smaller</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      exchanged detailed shopping cart to a clickable icon when
                      page is small enough
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      made a one-column, scrolling solution on small screens
                    </p>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
            My new design attempts to consolidate the page, making what needs to
            be visible prominent while removing redundancies and unnecessary
            information. There was also a fair amount of accessibility issues
            which I addressed, including:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>Language not identified</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>The HTML was not split into regions</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Images without alternative text</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Certain areas (e.g. shopping cart) had low contrast between
                  text and background
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Adjacent links go to the same URL (photo and header links)
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Underlined text that isn't a link</p>
              </li>
            </ul>

            For the style guide, I tried to use simple, organic colors, looking
            to replicate the cozy, "hygge" feeling that many bookstores,
            including Powerhouse, play into. Their current website uses metallic
            and modern colors, which seems discordant with their brick and
            mortar branding. For interactions, I tried to keep it in line with
            the dominant trends, not making any choices that wouldn't be seen
            elsewhere and the user wouldn't be used to.

            I, to the best of my HTML and CSS abilities, implemented my Figma
            mockup. Thanks to my use of flexboxes, the design was already
            responsive across screen sizes. I did, however, have to do some CSS
            tricks to make a one column solution on mobile pages. I used the{" "}
            <a
              href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_mediaquery.asp"
              target="_blank"

            >
              @media
            </a>{" "}
            rule to create a single column solution when the screen size was
            below 750px. At that size, I also unhid the shopping cart icon,
            removed the detailed shopping cart. <br />
            <br />
            There were a few discrepancies (thanks to my limited web-dev
            abilities) between the Hi-Fi prototype and the HTML page, such as
            fonts, minor alignment issues, and the ability to implement a
            carousel. I also did not implement the (ideal + prototyped) infinite
            scroll, but stuck to four browsing rows.
